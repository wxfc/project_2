## Process:

When creating this app, I first started writing wireframes to create a map of how this was to be compelted and what I wanted to accomplish with this app.

I looked at what tables would be required for the database (see below) and what features I wanted for the app.

Then I looked at how I wanted to map the paths of the app and mocking up how each page would look.

Before getting down to code, I created a Trello board (https://trello.com/b/SkqYw51n/project-2) to help organise my process and to keep track of the minor things to do as well as the major parts of the app.

Tables created with SQL:
- Users
- Houses

## Challenges:

The main challenges I had was to do with broken paths and syntax errors. Using the errors, I was able to fix my issues and navigate more cleanly through the paths.
